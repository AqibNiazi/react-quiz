# 🧠 React Quiz Application

This is a **React-based Quiz Application** where users can test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions within a limited time. Each question has a countdown timer, and users must select an answer before the time runs out. Once an answer is selected or time expires, the result is immediately shown. At the end of the quiz, a comprehensive summary of the user's performance is displayed.
